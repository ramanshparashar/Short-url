// the Redirect url which would be taking from the users request and the reason to store it is we would be needing it to perform the redirect logic meaning the user should
// be able to visit the original site using the short url as well. The last thing here is the visit history which would be having the detail about our url getting clicked everytime,
// it would be having the timestamp in it showing when was the URL been clicked, along with the date.
